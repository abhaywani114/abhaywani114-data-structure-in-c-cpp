# Data structure in C and C++
A deep dive into data structures and algorithms using C and C++.
> Tested using `gcc version 10.2.0 (GCC)`

### Basic Concepts ###
#### What is Abastract Data Type (ADT)? ####
ADT is a layer of a mathematical model that defines data and operation but no implementation details. Ex: Arrays.

### Programs ###
- **List Using Array:** demonstrating an *unsigned int list* implementation as an ADT that should be capable to `insert`, `remove`, `modify`,  and, `count` elements.
- **Linked List:** contains programs related to linked list.
