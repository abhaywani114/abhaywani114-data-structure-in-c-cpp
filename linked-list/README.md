#### What is Linked List? ####
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

#### What is Linked List's advantages over arrays? ####
Linked List is a dynamic data structure that means it is always trying to use memory efficently. Linked list can be extented to infinite number of elements. For storing a long list linked list is ideal. Unlike arrays whose memory allocation is static that means we can't extent it alfter allocation.

## Programs ###
- **Linked List P1:** demonstrating an *int list* implementation as using linked list that should be capable to `insert`, `remove`, `print`, and, `count` elements using C.
- **Linked List P2:** demonstrating an *int list* implementation as using linked list that should be capable to `insert`, and, `print elements using C++.
